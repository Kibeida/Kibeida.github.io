							<h1>This is Osama</h1>
							<h1>History of experience </h1>
							<p class="major">My most recent role was at Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Dublin, Ireland. I worked as a Graduate Cloud Support Associate as part of a graduate program. I joined the program shortly after completing a computer science master in University College Cork in Cork, Ireland. I also spent a short period working for Globetech in Cork, working on Linguistic Analysis on Apple’s Siri.   
								Before moving to Ireland to pursue my Masters, I spent a few years in Dubai UAE working for dnata, a global ground handling service provider where I was a Ramp Operations Team Leader.
								In Sudan, my last role was a one year project working as an Interpreter/Translator contractor for the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Before that, and for over two years, I was an IT Assistant working for the United Nations Mission in Sudan, providing technical support for the UN Logistic Base in North Kordofan.

							<h2>Technical skills</h2>
							<p>Throughout my experience, the technical roles I undertook required different skills based on the job requirements, and I always made sure I worked hard to develop and teach myself what I am missing to do my job as expected.
								<ul>Among these skills: 
								</ul>

								<ul>

									<li>      Diagnosis and troubleshooting skills required in case of incidents with server and security systems on Cisco and component-based LAN/WAN infrastructures. </li>
									<li>      The know-how in configuring, testing, and deploying security related server hardware, software, and systems, including their operating systems.</li>
									<li>      A basic knowledge of Networking concepts such as TCP/IP, UDP, and DNS. Also, the use of network traffic and packet analysis diagnosis tools such as Wireshark.</li>
									<li>      Knowledge of database management systems including, MySql and MariaDB.</li>
									<li>      Good understanding of OS concepts and Linux administration.</li>

							<h2>Transferable skills</h2>
							<p>My work history has been a mixed bag of experiences in different fields and different geographical locations. Each role I undertook, taught me something new that helped me develop and progress in the roles that followed. I have learned to take ownership of issues and never to say that “this is not my job”.

								I am comfortable working in a team with others so as to share my knowledge and learn from others. This helps both me and the team to develop and operate in order to contribute effectively.
								In some roles, I had to lead small teams to achieve specific business targets with difficult time constraints.
								All my previous roles required that I communicate and report both verbally and in writing. I have developed communications skills through this accumulation of experience.
								I have always had a hunger for knowledge and am keen on developing myself in the areas where I feel I need to develop so as to fulfill both my personal and career goals.

							<h2>Why I want to return to tech</h2>
							<p>LOne of the exciting aspects of the technology industry is the pace of innovation and development within the field.
								Although I have had to take a break from work for some time and I do have other skills that allow me to work and earn, my hunger for learning, developing myself, and pushing myself to my limits is what makes me want to return to tech.
